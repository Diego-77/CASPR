    Needed Changes
        Remove depreciated workspace classes

        Add linearisation
            Steps
                1. Set up B matrix (this is simply [0;-M^-1L^T])
                2. Set up A matrix
                    - Compute gradient of M
                    - Compute gradient of C (this may be a good point to move N matrix into tensor form)
                    - Compute gradient of G
                3. Is C necessary?

        Integrate control and MP
            Add functions such that MP output is suitable control input
            Fix the MPC with the correct linearisation functions

    Time permitting
        Add weighted barycentres to ID

        Add warmstart as a general optimiser options

        Update control GUI to handle all controllers

        Update workspace GUI such that feasible sets can be given a inputs.

        Add revolute with arbitrary axis.

        Add dexterity and condition number based metrics.

        Fix how metrics and conditions are handled. Particularly ensure that computation is only
        performed once.
