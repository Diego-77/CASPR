Change Log
    Needed Changes
        Remove depreciated workspace classes
        
        Add Hessian
            Steps
                1. Add a new library for Tensor operations (first operation should be product)    
                2. Add update_hessian function
                3. Taken individual S_grads and combine to form larger S_grad (should be diagonal)
                4. Compute P_grad
                    - First write out the rotation expression (maybe this should go into the tensor library)
                    - Then compute what I need for translational vectors
                5. Compute V_grad

        Add linearisation
            Steps
                1. Set up B matrix (this is simply [0;-M^-1L^T])
                2. Set up A matrix
                    - Compute gradient of M
                    - Compute gradient of C (this may be a good point to move N matrix into tensor form)
                    - Compute gradient of G
                3. Is C necessary?

        Integrate control and MP
            Add functions such that MP output is suitable control input
            Fix the MPC with the correct linearisation functions

    Time permitting
        Add weighted barycentres to ID

        Add warmstart as a general optimiser options

        Update control GUI to handle all controllers

        Update workspace GUI such that feasible sets can be given a inputs.

        Fix how metrics and conditions are handled. Particularly ensure that computation is only
        performed once.
